# vcaen's dotfiles

## What are dotfiles ?

The name _dotfiles_ comes from the concept files whose name is prefixed with a dot `.`. 
Those files are usually hidden in Linux and MacOS, and are used to save configurations for various programs.

If one wants to save the customization they made to those configuration file, it's a good practice to back them up somehere. 
I decided to go the Github route to be able to share them to the world.

## What is special about my dotfiles ?

I've been working on Android at Google for 7 years and my dotfiles reflect the tooling I need to be more productive. 

I usually share them with new teammates when they join the team to help them setup their own workflow. 
But I also insist on them just cherry-picking the tools they need, because utlimiatlty the best workflow for you is 
the one you made for yourself.

## My workflow

To better understand what is in my dotfiles, let me explain the tools I use:

 - **Hardware**
     - I work mainly on a Linux desktop locally or remotly via my Mac.
       
 - **Shell**
     - My Shell is setup to zsh with .oh-my-zsh to improve the experience
     - Most of the time I use tmux, but few of my scripts are not dependent on it
     - I recently discover fzf, so I integrate it more and more with my scripts.
     - I don't have a particular prefence for the terminal emulators: kitty, gnome-ternmail, iTerm2 on Mac.

 - **Tools**:
     - I extensively use git and repo (a wrapper made by Google to manage multiple Git repository at the same time).
     - My window manager is i3wm (made by another Googler ;) )
     - I use IntelliJ/Andorid Studio and VS Code as my main IDE and file editor.
